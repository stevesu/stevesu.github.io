## ABOUT THIS SITE

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/wheel.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

This website is all about Steven Su. You may wondering why it has such unique name and it looks like a apex domain. In fact it is! The .SU domain name was assigned as the country code top-level domain for the Soviet Union back in 1990, and it remains in use today. And it happens to be same as my surname - so here I have a domain identical to my name ;)
