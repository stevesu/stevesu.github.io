Everyone reckon that if you like typing you need a mechnical keyboard. For me there is another reason - I just can't stand the keyboard of my MacBook Pro, the key travel is soo short that it's just like typing on a brick!

I need a keyboard has:
- Looks simple and neat
- Works with Macbook
- Bluetooth connection
- Full sized function keys and arrow keys

## Keychron K2
Keychon K2 is already pupular - for it has all features listed above and very reasonable price. Here in Australia it cost $139 for RGB version, still one of the best option on the market. 

I like the feeling/sound of blue swith but I don't want to disturb others too much so I choosed red switch. It has default Mac keys configured/installed which make it a perfect mate for my Macbook. And ... it comes with 15 different lighting modes - who doesn't like RGBs?
